change background color

Hi!
This small project was a lot of fun to make. My goal was to continue practicing vanilla js to change the background color of the three boxes on the page. This was a fun exercise to reinforce my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners,  handlers and functions and how to connect all the pieces together to make it functional and interactive.

Notes: 

implemented math functions into simple random color generator in several color formats
can attach event listeners to button variables instead of creating separate handlers, practiced creating functions to manipulate DOM
implemented a "master" function to change the bg color of all boxes at once, by feeding into one master function
