change background color

Hi!
This small project was a lot of fun to make. My goal here was to continue practicing vanilla js to change the background color of the three boxes on the page. This was a fun exercise to reinforce my understanding of DOM manipulation, event listeners,  handlers and functions and how to connect all the pieces together to make it functional.

Notes: 

can attach event listeners to button variables instead of creating separate handlers
practiced creating functions 
implemented a "master" function to change the bg color of all boxes at once, by feeding into one master function
